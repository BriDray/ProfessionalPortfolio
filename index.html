            <p class="aboutblurb"> 
                This is a work in progress... It's a bunch of random thoughts. 
                A very very very rough draft. So bare with me here.
                    I am a 31 year old female with two children ages, six and eleven.
                    My interest are many and varied because I enjoy learning new skills. For many years I have been 
                interested in computers and gaming. It is fascinating how gaming and graphics have changed over the years.
                Creativity helps to calm me. Coming up with new ideas and designs is a challenge I enjoy. Then the next challenge 
                I face is how, when, and where to use these ideas.
                    Some examples of creative things Iâ€™ve done are t-shirt and tumblers designs, resin jewelry and key chains. More 
                recently I have gotten into 3D printing and learning the CAD programs.
                    Outside of technology and art. My interests lie with my family and animals. A few years ago, during the COVID 
                Pandemic. I was living in the suburbs with my family really feeling the need for more space and being more self 
                sufficient. So we moved to a more rural setting hoping to teach my kids some of the important life skills and embark 
                on a new adventure together. So far we have planted a garden that provides food for our family and established a 
                flock of chickens that provide us with the best colorful eggs! My family is the reason for my motivation to learn, 
                plan, and try new things.  
                    I grew up in a family dedicated to scouting. So naturally, when my kids were old enough. They joined scouts and I 
                had the privilege to lead a den for a year. I was able to work in a group setting to plan a program for youth to learn 
                new things in an exciting way.
                    Scouts, my high school experiences being the editor in chief for my schools yearbook, and being part of the community 
                outreach for my class are what gave me the skills to collaborate with others. It also taught me the importance of 
                following though, important communication skills, how to be resourceful, how to be detail oriented, and not to be 
                afraid to try new things.
                    Thank you so much for being here to check out my portfolio!

                The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a guide I created 
                to help me stay organized for School. Taking a new 
                course can be stressful, I wanted to have my important 
                notes all in one place to make studying easier and more 
                efficient. I learned a lot with this project. I'm totally 
                new to coding, so this was a lot of fun to do.
