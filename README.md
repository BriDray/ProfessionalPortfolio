## Installation
No install needed. This is a deployed project that you can view via the browser.

## Credits
This was a solo project done on my own, Credits go to Bri Dray.

## Project Status
This project is still being added to/adjusted as my skills widen. 
What you will see thus far:
*A Header with my name and working NavBar.
*An About Me section
*A Portfolio section with places for Project title, A screen shot of my work, A blurb about each project, and a way to view the full project. All of which will be added as my skill improves.
*A Contact Me form. This is not currently linked to anything, but will be soon!
*And lastly, a footer.
This project was also to help me practice:
*Starting a project from scratch.
*A major skill practiced was Flexbox.

## Tests
None at this time.
