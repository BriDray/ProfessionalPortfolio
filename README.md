#Description:
 This is my Professional Portfolio that I intend to update and add to as I learn! This project is one I hope will come in handy once i'm ready to apply to jobs in the field. 

#What you will see thus far!:
- A Header with my name and working NavBar.
- An About Me section
- A Portfolio section with places for Project title, A screen shot of my work, A blurb about each project, and a way to view the full project. All of which will be added as my skill improves.
- A Contact Me form. This is not currently linked to anything, but will be soon!
- And lastly, a footer.

#This project was also to help me practice 
- Starting a project from scratch.
- A major skill practiced was Flexbox.
